# Sentiment Analysis using BERT

This project demonstrates how to use BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis. It involves fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model on a sentiment classification task to predict positive or negative sentiment from text data.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a key application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves classifying text data based on its sentiment. In this project, I used the BERT architecture, which has revolutionized NLP by providing a state-of-the-art method for understanding the context of words in a sentence. Fine-tuning BERT on a sentiment classification dataset allows us to leverage this powerful model for accurate sentiment predictions.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The project involves cleaning and tokenizing raw text data to prepare it for input into the BERT model.
- **BERT Model Fine-Tuning**: BERT is fine-tuned on the sentiment dataset to adjust its weights for the specific task.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results

The fine-tuned BERT model achieves impressive performance on the sentiment classification task. The project showcases the power of BERT in understanding the nuances of language and accurately predicting sentiment in text.
